        " Python is a dynamic, high-level, open-source programming language that is free to use and interpreted. It supports both object-oriented and procedural programming, making it versatile for different coding styles. Compared to languages like C, C#, JavaScript, and Java, Python is much easier to learn, with a simple syntax that allows beginners to grasp the basics in just a few hours or days. Pythonâ€™s readability and simplicity make it accessible to anyone. As an interpreted language, Python executes code line by line, which simplifies debugging, unlike languages such as C, C++, and Java, where code compilation is required.\n"
